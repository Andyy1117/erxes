My two biggest ones prior to TUF were Stork and the Seattle Testbed. Stork is a package manager that was designed to work well in environments with lots of OSVMs running on shared hardware similar to a normal server / desktop. I started the project back in 2002, when this environment was much more rare. \u201cThe cloud\u201d wasn\u2019t a buzzword I heard until much later, but Stork was really the first package manager expressly designed to work in the cloud."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"I started the Seattle testbed project in 2008 as a \u201cfog computing\u201d platform, which is like cloud environment, but running on edge devices like laptops, smartphones, wireless routers, etc. At its peak, we had about 35K systems you could run software on. One cool thing is that we basically abstracted away all of the platform differences so you didn\u2019t even know if you were on a Macbook, a one-laptop-per-child with a hand crank, a Nokia N800 phone, a beefy Linux server, a Windows Mobile phone, etc. \u2014 your code just worked and masked the OS differences from you. More than 100 different developers (most of them students) contributed to the code. While we still use the code ourselves internally for projects and educational purposes, we officially retired the project a few years ago. The NSF (National Science Foundation) had kindly helped to support it for many years, but in the end we struggled to find enough funding to maintain it. I had a student who worked on that project contact me and say that they had looked 8+ years later to see how others had solved some of the OS portability problems we worked on in that project and that what we had done was still state-of-the-art and unique. I\u2019m really proud that what we did is still useful and viable even now."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Both Seattle and Stork were primarily used by academic researchers, rather than other open source folks. This had a different community dynamic, which had a lot of pros and cons in terms of your typical open source project today. A lot of students worked on my lab\u2019s projects, some of whom are absolutely excellent. However, many who are still learning also become solid contributors after a little while getting up to speed. So the challenges involved were often in making the projects places where almost anyone could contribute, but it was really hard to mess anything up."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"I definitely learned a bit from each project I worked on in this regard. With Stork (2002-2009), this was really my first project where I realized the value and difficulties in including a lot of outside help. I had about 20 different undergraduate researchers working on the project with me at one time or another. I wrote a first working draft of almost all of the original code (with tests and comments) and then had students help to flesh out corner cases, add features, etc. However, I was not rigorous about what form the contributions were in and very quickly there became dark corners of the code where we were hesitant to change for fear of breaking something. After a lot of frustrating time debugging unclear code from students long gone, I realized the problems with that approach."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"So, in the Seattle testbed (2008-2018), we required contributions to follow a fairly strict set of code style guidelines and testing guidelines. Documentation was in many ways more important than code. This seemed to work well in general because the code was clean enough that people diving in would be sympathetic that we weren\u2019t going to take a patch that \u201cworked\u201d, if it didn\u2019t fit clearly in a maintainable way in our code. At that time we were also running a custom, primitive CI/CD system we hand rolled to test and deploy changes quickly.

When I did this, I was quite shocked that there were concerning problems. We found we could cause outdated, vulnerable software to be installed on basically any Linux distro and that the ones we asked all accepted request from an unknown party to run an official mirror.

We were much more interested in working with communities like Python, Debian, etc. So we were sort of being pulled in different directions. It was a bit of a crazy time."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"I also had the Seattle Testbed have a major adoption upswing while TUF was just sort of slowly chugging along. That meant that I was splitting my time and energy between the two. For a while Seattle looked like it might be transformative, before we came to the realization that using end user provided resources seemed to be too flaky / poor to really make up for the latency gain. That was compounded by the fact the Seattle Testbed\u2019s programming model was a little different, in part to deal with the OS differences. I am not sure to what extent those lessons still hold today, but this wasn\u2019t obvious 2ish years into that project when we were roughly doubling in size every year. So Seattle Testbed was definitely what folks in academia knew me for at the time and had a lot of community-building time demands.

One thing we struggle a little with even today is that someone views the things we do as just something academic. Now that we have a few projects that have large scale adoption, this is less of a problem. Back then, the security model in Stork had been adopted by YUM, YaST, apt, Pacman, etc. but people in the broader open source community really hadn\u2019t heard of Stork and the Seattle testbed.

We had worked a bit to standardize TUF for the Python community. Many different folks took notice of this, including Docker\u2019s security team.

As part of Notary\u2019s deployment, Docker\u2019s team also saw a bunch of usability challenges and they made a few decisions to deploy things in certain ways. Their adoption really helped to make visible some usability challenges and forced us to formalize some less precise parts of TUF. No longer was it just our implementation we had to worry about, but we had Notary also to be concerned with. We and other folks that have deployed TUF learned a lot from that process.
